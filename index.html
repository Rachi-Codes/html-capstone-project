               <h3> Other Interests</h3>
               <p> I also enjoy reading as much as i enjoy coding. My love for reading has been a dfining part of who i am. Books like the laws of Human Nature by Robert Greene have not only depeened my understanding of human behaviour, but have also sharpened my ability to think critically, observe patterns, and respond thoughtfully
                ,skills that translate seamlessly into the world of coding. Just as a book draws you into its stucture and flow, coding invites the same kind of attention to detail and narrative design. Each function, like each paragraph, must serve a purpose and connect meaningfully to the whole. For me, reading is not just a passion, its a mental gym that builds the resilience, depth and analytical thinking i apply to every project i take on as a developer.
